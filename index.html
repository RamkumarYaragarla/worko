---
<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hi there, I'm Ramkumar Yaragarla</h1>
	<p> I openly embrace the internet culture in all its quirkiness <em> It's a beautiful life</em> and Life is always good </p>
	 
	 My home site is at <a href="http://www.workmonkeylabs.com"> Work Monkey Labs</a>.
	 <p>I have just started on Github and Gitpages for web development for Work Monkey labs. More to come. Will take it one by one. Looking for more 
		 contributors.</p>
	 <p>Work Monkey labs has a unique brand voice on the intersection between social collaboration, social networks, Crowds, 
		 Collective intelligence and Swarms. </P>
	 <p> We love being an individual with all our likes, dislikes and interest and yet find comfort and strength in numbers. We love the safety and companionship of others.
	 there is dichotomy as well as merits in being social</P>
         <p>We stand to gain by being part of a group. United we stand divided we fall.</p>
