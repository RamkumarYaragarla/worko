This is my first repository with Github.
<p>Through this repository we would like to store all new project files related to web development for <a href="http://www.workmonkeylabs.com"> Work Monkey Labs</a>. Being an open source project, we request contributing members to bear with us. </p>
<p>This read me page will be updated soon from time to time.</p>

<p>The content in the posts folder is copyrighted and licensed. </p>
<p>However you are free to use the html and css files. Best wishes. <p>
